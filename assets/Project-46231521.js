In my app, I aim to personalize the grammar learning experience by drawing inspiration from Duolingo. Users will follow a linear structure of lessons, including course content and tests. Using React-flow, I've created a 2D visual representation of levels, allowing users to progress to the next topic once they achieve a sufficient score. I'm also collecting user attempts and mistakes, which are displayed on a dashboard view.
